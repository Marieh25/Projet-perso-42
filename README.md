## Description :

- ft_atoi.c : The atoi() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by nptr to int.

- ft_bzero.c : The bzero() function erases the data in the n bytes of the memory starting at the location pointed to by s, by writing zeros to that area.

- ft_calloc : The calloc() function  allocates  memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.

- ft_isalnum : These functions check whether c, which must have the value of an unsigned char or EOF, falls  into a certain character class according to the specified locale.

- ft_isalpha : Checks for an alphabetic character.

- ft_isascii : Checks whether c is a 7-bit unsigned char value that fits into the ASCII character set.

- ft_isprint : Checks for any printable character including space.

- ft_isdigit : Checks for a digit (0 through 9).

- ft_itoa : The ft_itoa function does the opposite work of ft_atoi, converting a number to a string.
